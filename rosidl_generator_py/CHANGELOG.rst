  Before this patch, publishing a message with "ros2 topic pub" would print something like:
  ``publishing #5: my_msgs.msg.my_msg(axes=array('f', [0.0]))``
  While that is OK, it is kind of ugly.
  This patch hides the typecode and the "array" so that the output looks like:
  ``publishing #5: my_msgs.msg.my_msg(axes=[0.0])``
